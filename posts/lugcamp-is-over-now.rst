One of the craziest but coolest events ended on Sunday with a big tombola and something called "Improvortag", some nonsense but really funny speeches.

For those of you that don't know about it, it is an event where 4 things are mixed together:
- Meeting other Lug's members
- Having some speeches (only some, not the whole 4 days)
- One local event (here it was visiting brewery and an alpine dairy)
- Fun fun fun....

It really has a non-commercial/non-advertising trait, and feels more like a big LUG-LAN things than anything else. As an addon you have a "coffee flatrate" and get at least one meal a day for free.

The announced Open Radio live event didn't take place because of some problems with the dialup internet connection we were offered there. We're really sad about that but we still had a lot of fun without it.

Someone once said "geeks always find other geeks in random places". This should be sed s/geeks/devs/ here ;) I met genstef there and we took a nice picture with The Alps in background :)

I'm really looking forward to LugCamp @ Father's Day 2007 as these ~150 people there are just like a big family :D
