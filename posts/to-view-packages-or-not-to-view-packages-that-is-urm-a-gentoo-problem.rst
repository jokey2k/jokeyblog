So you read it in the title. Yes it sounds weird, by intention. When our primary site for package viewing went down some time ago, I didn't notice much. It was more a good friend of mine asking me if I know when it will be back. Okay, it was down for three days so no big deal if something serious happened. You know the rest of the story or can read it up on the bug (just don't comment there unless real help offered).

But why am I writing about this here? Well, also some time ago, araujo and me started something called gui project. Main target was obviously getting some nice gui for our day-to-day tasks. I don't really know where (maybe some mailinglist) it came to my ears that our obviously loved packages site was down more a month. So hey, we're a gui project, I more or less have finished my previous tinderbox thingy (just minor stuff open). So some spare time available. I never did a webpage yet with a python based framework so I decided to give some of them a try and if I would find a nice and not bloated one, this could be worth a try.

Two days of trying different ones later, I finally got settled with cherrypy and genshi (there's a nice tutorial on the genshi homepage if you're curious now)..

After some thinking about databases and stuff, finally got a db generator going resulting in data useful for such a site. That's the moment where I started to git the code and let the show begin. In the meantime I was on holiday for more than a week so you might notice some inactivity in the timeline. Anyway, at least startpage and some filtering works. See http://sources.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=packages.git;a=summary for working features of the live version at http://packages.gentoo.org

It's a starting project, mind you, though basics are working now, more stuff to come. If you have questions or comments, feel free to join irc.freenode.net #gentoo-guis , cookies are on topic
