For 10 years, there now is a meeting called Lugcamp, where Linux geeks in and around germany meet. As we have 10th anniversary here, some special location was needed. So the LUGA, which was the LUG hosting it this year, aquired a youth hostel in Allgäu.

Smaller talks have some kind of tradidion at these camps, namingly being heavily dynamic. You start preparing a talk about an hour or two before it starts.

When the first talk was about start, people noticed a small bug… Missing canvas. 2 people were ordered to pick one up but they did not arrive yet, so the dynamic part this time would be actually having some kind of canwas.

All in all it’s fun every year. If you speak german, you can get some additional info about it at LUG Camp 2009 site

Here’s a pic of what we came up with as canvas ;)
