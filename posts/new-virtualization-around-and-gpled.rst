.. description: The first virtualization which is completely free and open
.. type: text

Okay, today there was a nice announcement on heise... "Open-source competitor takes on VMware and Co."

So we have an open-source virtualizer now? Yes we do :) The test on the page showed that it's only a bit slower compared to the other mentioned virtualizer, so I gave it a run and it worked okay from the first moment. Stats indicated that there were some binaries around but we don't like binaries if we can get the source, right? ;)

I've put a masked live ebuild in the tree and in fact we're the first distro that has virtualbox in the official repository. So give it a run if you want to see the power of open source :)

There are good docs available on the homepage but if everything fails, you can stop by in #vbox on freenode (upstream irc channel)
