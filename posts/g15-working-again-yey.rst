.. description: Logitech breaks and unbreaks with 2.6.18
.. type: text

So it has been a pretty long time since I blogged something but this is something important :D

As I'm back from a big Christmas party of one of our great local LUGs here, I'm happy to announce that being two days late, we have libg15-1.1.1 in the tree. For those who are thinking "why is that so important?" here's the reason:

For all those people who have these nice G15 keyboards from Logitech, as of today we have back working G and M keys with latest kernels :). The keys stopped working starting with kernel 2.6.18 as it introduced some USB API rewrite. With some (detailed) input from some of our users and developers, we helped the upstream maintainer to track the issue down and it's fixed now.

So a big THANK YOU to all involved to make these fancy G15 keyboards working with linux.
