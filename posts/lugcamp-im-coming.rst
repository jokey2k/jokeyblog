So after a lot of preparation, the one-and-only LugCamp takes place the next days (from 25th - 28th of May).

Problems in preparation? Well, the Inbox of the orga's is currently out of quota, the "Deutsche Bahn" sold some too expensive tickets but, well, FUN is the target :) So going by EuroNight train (takes approx. 11 hours) from north to south.

I'm also there as student apprentice for Open Radio, so let's see what we enjoy this year :)
